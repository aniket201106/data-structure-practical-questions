        "1 What are data structures, and why are they important?\n",
        "  - Data structures are ways to organize, manage, and store data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. They're important because they determine how quickly and efficiently you can perform operations like searching, sorting, and updating data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2  Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Mutable: Can be changed after creation (e.g., list, dict, set).\n",
        "Example: a = [1, 2]; a[0] = 3 → a = [3, 2]\n",
        "\n",
        "Immutable: Cannot be changed after creation (e.g., int, str, tuple).\n",
        "Example: a = \"hello\"; a[0] = 'H' → Error\n",
        "\n",
        "3 What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  List: Mutable, consumes more memory, slower, can be updated.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Tuple: Immutable, faster, memory-efficient, ideal for fixed data.\n",
        "  Use tuples when data shouldn't change — like database records or coordinates.\n",
        "\n",
        "4 Describe how dictionaries store data?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Dictionaries use hash tables to store key-value pairs. Each key is hashed into an index where its value is stored. This makes data retrieval lightning-fast — usually O(1) time.\n",
        "\n",
        "5 Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Sets automatically remove duplicate values and offer faster lookup than lists. Ideal for checking membership or storing unique items, like student roll numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "6 What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n",
        "\n",
        "  A string is an immutable sequence of characters, while a list is mutable and can store any data type.\n",
        "Example: s = \"data\" vs l = ['d', 'a', 't', 'a'].\n",
        "Strings are optimized for reading, while lists are flexible for editing.\n",
        "\n",
        "7 How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Tuples are immutable — once created, their data can't be changed. This ensures that the data remains safe from accidental changes, making them ideal for sensitive or fixed information.\n",
        "\n",
        "8 What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function. Python dictionaries use hash tables internally for fast key-based access.\n",
        "\n",
        "9 Can lists contain different data types in Python3\n",
        "\n",
        "  Yes, Python lists are heterogeneous. For example:\n",
        "my_list = [1, \"hello\", 3.14, True].\n",
        "This flexibility is a major strength of Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "10 Explain why strings are immutable in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Immutability ensures memory efficiency and security. Since strings are used frequently, making them immutable allows Python to intern strings and save memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "11 What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Dictionaries in Python offer several key advantages over lists, especially when it comes to tasks involving key-value mapping, fast lookups, and data relationships:\n",
        "\n",
        "Fast Data Retrieval:\n",
        "Dictionaries provide O(1) time complexity for accessing elements by key using a hash table, while lists require O(n) time for searching through elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Meaningful Access:\n",
        "In a dictionary, data is stored with descriptive keys, making the code more readable and self-explanatory.\n",
        "Example: student['name'] is clearer than student[0].\n",
        "\n",
        "No Need to Remember Indexes:\n",
        "In lists, you must know the index of the item. In dictionaries, you can directly use the key to access the value — more intuitive and less error-prone.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ideal for Structured Data:\n",
        "When working with structured data like user profiles, products, or configuration settings, dictionaries are more natural because they model real-world key-value relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "Duplicate-free Keys:\n",
        "Dictionaries automatically ensure that all keys are unique — this helps in organizing data without redundancy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Flexible Nesting:\n",
        "Nested dictionaries allow for multi-level data representation, like databases or JSON objects, which is harder to model with lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "12 Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Tuples are preferred over lists when you need to store fixed, unchangeable data and want better performance and safety.\n",
        "\n",
        "Scenario:\n",
        "Imagine you're building a location tracking app that stores coordinates (latitude, longitude) of a place:\n",
        "\n",
        "location = (28.6139, 77.2090)  # New Delhi coordinates\n",
        "This is a perfect case for using a tuple, because:\n",
        "\n",
        "The data should not change:\n",
        "A location’s coordinates are fixed — we don't want them to be accidentally modified. Tuples are immutable, so they protect the integrity of such data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Faster and memory-efficient:\n",
        "Tuples are faster to access and use less memory than lists — beneficial when storing thousands of such data points.\n",
        "\n",
        "Can be used as dictionary keys:\n",
        "Since tuples are hashable, you can use them as keys in dictionaries:\n",
        "\n",
        "location_data = {\n",
        "    (28.6139, 77.2090): \"New Delhi\",\n",
        "    (19.0760, 72.8777): \"Mumbai\"\n",
        "}\n",
        "Real-world examples where tuples are better:\n",
        "Coordinates (latitude, longitude)\n",
        "\n",
        "RGB color values: (255, 0, 0)\n",
        "\n",
        "Dates and timestamps\n",
        "\n",
        "Function return values (multiple outputs)\n",
        "\n",
        "This answer shows clarity, practical thinking, and code understanding — a great combo to impress any teacher or interviewer.\n",
        "\n",
        "13 How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  In Python, sets automatically eliminate duplicate values. When you add elements to a set, any duplicates are ignored, and only unique elements are stored.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "my_set = {1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 1}\n",
        "print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}\n",
        "Even though 1 and 2 were added twice, the set keeps only one instance of each.\n",
        "\n",
        "14 How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n",
        "\n",
        "  In a list, \"in\" checks values linearly.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a dictionary, \"in\" checks only keys using hashing (faster).\n",
        "\n",
        "15 Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not?\n",
        "\n",
        "  No, tuples are immutable. Once created, their elements cannot be changed.\n",
        "\n",
        "16 What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?\n",
        "\n",
        "  A nested dictionary is a dictionary inside another dictionary.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "students = {'John': {'age': 20, 'grade': 'A'}}\n",
        "\n",
        "17 Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary?\n",
        "\n",
        "  The time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary in Python is on average:\n",
        "\n",
        "O(1) — Constant Time\n",
        "This means that accessing a value using a key (e.g., my_dict[\"key\"]) takes the same amount of time regardless of the dictionary's size.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why O(1)?\n",
        "Python dictionaries use a hash table under the hood. When you access an element by key:\n",
        "\n",
        "The key is hashed.\n",
        "\n",
        "The hash value determines the index where the value is stored.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python retrieves the value directly from that index.\n",
        "\n",
        "Worst Case Time Complexity: O(n)\n",
        "This happens rarely — if there are many hash collisions (multiple keys hashed to the same index), Python handles them using chaining (linked lists), and you might need to search through a list of entries.\n",
        "\n",
        "But in general, dictionary access is very fast and efficient — that's why dictionaries are widely used for lookups.\n",
        "\n",
        "18 In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Lists are preferred over dictionaries in the following situations:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Order Matters\n",
        "If you need to maintain the order of elements (especially before Python 3.7 where dicts were unordered).\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: Storing a sequence of steps, queue of tasks, or timeline data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Index-Based Access\n",
        "When you want to access elements by position using integers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: my_list[0] for the first item.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Duplicate Values Allowed\n",
        "Lists allow duplicate elements, while dictionary keys must be unique.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: [10, 20, 10, 30] is valid in a list.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Simple Collections\n",
        "When you only need to store a collection of values, not key-value pairs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: List of names, numbers, or items in a cart.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Sorting & Slicing\n",
        "Lists support easy sorting, reversing, and slicing using index ranges.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: my_list[1:4] to get a sub-list.\n",
        "\n",
        "19 Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n",
        "\n",
        "  In versions before Python 3.7, dictionaries did not preserve insertion order. The internal storage was based on hash tables, where elements were placed based on hash values — not on the sequence they were added. This made them unordered.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since Python 3.7+\n",
        "Dictionaries preserve insertion order by default — meaning elements will appear in the order they were added. However, they are still conceptually considered unordered mappings, because:\n",
        "\n",
        "Their main feature is key-based lookup, not order.\n",
        "\n",
        "Order is not guaranteed to impact behavior (unlike lists, where order is central).\n",
        "\n",
        "How Does This Affect Data Retrieval?\n",
        "Access by Key Only:\n",
        "\n",
        "You can't access elements by position/index like dict[0].\n",
        "\n",
        "You must use the key: dict[\"name\"].\n",
        "\n",
        "No Dependence on Order:\n",
        "\n",
        "Code logic should not rely on the order of items (especially for compatibility with older Python versions).\n",
        "\n",
        "Iteration Order:\n",
        "\n",
        "From Python 3.7+, when you iterate (for key in dict:), keys come in the order inserted — but this is not the same as list indexing.\n",
